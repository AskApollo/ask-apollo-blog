Over the last decade, I have helped clients build robust and scalable solutions on the Salesforce platform. I have served the clients at Salesforce, Cognizant, CITI Bank, Deloitte US, iGate, Patni Computers. 

Then, in April 2022, after some introspection I found something was not fulfilling in the journey I was in.

So, I decided to walk away from my high-paying job.

I had an idea before leaving: 
I believed building solutions around pain points we face in adopting new changes/technologies will be of great value to all of us. And based on this I started my entrepreneurial journey.

The journey is on and I can say: I am enjoying every bit of it.
