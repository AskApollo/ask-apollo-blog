Language is the cornerstone of communication. When a customer reaches out for support, they expect to be understood clearly and to receive help in a language they’re 
comfortable with. In global commerce, multilingual support isn’t just nice to have; it’s a necessity. It allows businesses to expand their reach, cater to a diverse client 
base, and foster an inclusive brand reputation.

greeted by an AI chatbot that understands and speaks Italian fluently. The chatbot assists the customer through troubleshooting steps, and within minutes, the issue 
is resolved. The customer leaves the interaction feeling satisfied and valued, despite the miles and linguistic differences that separate them from the business.
