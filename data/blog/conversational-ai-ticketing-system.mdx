Conversational AI refers to the use of chatbots, messaging apps, and voice assistants to automate and personalize communication with customers. 
Integrating Conversational AI into ticketing systems transforms a formerly reactive, often slow customer service process into a proactive, engaging experience.

## The Impact of Conversational AI on Customer Support

### 1. Instantaneous Response Times
With Conversational AI, the moment a customer initiates a ticket or inquiry, they receive an immediate acknowledgment. This instant engagement assures them that 
their issue is being addressed, which mitigates frustration and sets the tone for a positive interaction.

### 2. Personalized Interactions
AI technologies can analyze customer data and previous interactions to tailor conversations to the individual's context and history with the company, 
delivering a much more personalized experience.

### 3. Efficient Issue Resolution
By understanding and categorizing customer issues through natural language processing, Conversational AI can route tickets to the correct department or 
even provide solutions on the spot for simpler issues, speeding up resolution times.

### 4. Availability Beyond Business Hours
One of the most critical advantages is that AI-driven systems are not constrained by business hours. They can provide quality support at all hours, which 
is particularly important in a global marketplace.

### 5. Feedback and Continuous Improvement
Conversational AI can collect feedback in real time after each resolved ticket, providing businesses with immediate insights into customer satisfaction 
levels and areas for improvement.
